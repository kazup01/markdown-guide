# Knowledge sharing tool for the developers by the developers
[Boost Hub](https://boosthub.io/) is a collaborative workspace for developers. Confluence and Notion are great tools for knowledge sharing, but they don't have enough features for developers. VSCode and Atom are great for coding, but they can't be used for knowledge sharing.

You know what? The [Boost Note](https://boostnote.io/) development team, which has delivered the tools to over a million developers, has created an ideal tool for professional developer teams like yours.
